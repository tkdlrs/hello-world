# hello-world
Hi world.

I am going to become a fullstack web developer. 

Beginning this stage in my quest to accomplish this goal I have already developed a solid knowledge of HTML and CSS. I've created and hosted my own website; however, I've done most of this with very little programming, everything thus far has been markup or stylizing. I've been learning about JavaScript on my own for a while now. But I am hoping to use GitHub to more formally develop my skills and share what I learn.
